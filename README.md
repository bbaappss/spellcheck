This Python code performs a simple spell-checking operation on a text file using a given dictionary. 

To run the spell check follow the instructions below: 
1. Download or clone the repo, 
2. Open terminal and navigate to the directory
3. Run the command `python spell-check.py`

Altering the text in the text_to_check.txt file and subsequently running the script will give you results on whatever text you have input.

The code doesn't explicitly implement an algorithm. It combines text parsing, regular expressions, set operations, and string comparisons to achieve spell-checking functionality.

I wanted to get as far as I could in the tasks listed, the next item I wanted to implement was proper noun checking via [NLTK]([(https://www.nltk.org/)]).
