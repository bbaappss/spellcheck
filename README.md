This Python code performs a simple spell-checking operation on a text file using a given dictionary. 

To run the spell check follow the instructions below: 
# download or clone the repo, 
# Open terminal and navigate to the directory
# Run the command `python spell-check.py`

The code doesn't explicitly implement an algorithm. It combines text parsing, regular expressions, set operations, and string comparisons to achieve spell-checking functionality.

I wanted to get as far as I could in the tasks listed, the next item I wanted to implement was proper noun checking via [NLTK]([url](https://www.nltk.org/)).
