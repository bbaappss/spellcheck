This Python code performs spell-checking operations on a text file against a given dictionary. 

To run the spellcheck follow the instructions below: 
1. Download or clone the repo
2. Open terminal and navigate to the directory
3. Run the command `python spell-check.py dictionary.txt text_to_check.txt`

Altering the text in the text_to_check.txt file and subsequently running the script will give you results on whatever text you have input.

The code combines text parsing, regular expressions, set operations, and string comparisons to achieve spell-checking functionality.

The next task I wanted to implement in this script was proper noun checking via [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/).
